			his daughter has recently moved to another city. Steve is lonely and needs to connect with like-minded individuals.
			<br>
			Steve has recently discovered that many of his favorite bands from his college days such as Journey and Rush
			are frequently playing at local casinos. A quick google search informs Steve that this is happening all over the country.
			Steve is excited to get back into the concert scene, and reconnect with	hip concert goers like himself.  Steve
			wants to join a community where he can post about his concert experiences and let people he meets know which concert
			he is going to next.</p>
